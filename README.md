Stock_Prediction
A machine learning project for predicting stock prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization of results using a Jupyter Notebook.

Features
Loads and preprocesses historical stock price data

Implements KNN regression for stock price prediction

Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/garg0711/Stock_Prediction.git
cd Stock_Prediction
Install required packages:
(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, install these common packages)

bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Usage
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Open and run:
Open KNN_Stock_Priceipynb.ipynb and run the cells step by step to see data processing, model training, and predictions.
